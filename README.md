# BabyDragon Readme

This is a repo for BabyDragon code written in Ruby. It's a Tamagotchi-style fire breather :)

## Getting Started:

Watch [this video](https://vimeo.com/157546255) and follow along. Google for answers when you get stuck. Getting stuck is a good sign- it means you're trying new things and learning what to do next.

### Recommended Prerequisites:

* Laptop
* Code editor- I used [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) This gives you access to irb, which you'll hear in the video.
* Internet connection when making the commits up to GitHub

### Doing this:

#### Level One:
You can follow along with writing the code down- anywhere is fine, the main thing is to familiarize yourself with the vocabulary and flow
#### Level Two:
As you follow along, write the code in a code editor like [Atom](https://atom.io/) and save the file to your computer. This means the file is "*saved locally.*" Make sure to save the file with the ending ".rb" to denote that it's code written in Ruby.
#### Level Three:
Have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) installed so that as you follow along with the video and write your own code in Atom, you can run the code in your terminal using IRB and see how it works!
#### Level Four:
Using the command line, move your code from your local machine up to GitHub by [Adding an existing project to GitHub using the command line](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/)

### Some things I ran into:
1. Email- [set it up to be private](https://help.github.com/articles/about-commit-email-addresses/)
2. Credentials- there are two main ways to do this- SSH or HTTPS. If you're doing HTTPS and your terminal asks you for credentials, it wants your GitHub username and your [**access token**](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/) not your GitHub password. Make sure to save this somewhere safe! From GitHub: "For security reasons, after you navigate off the page, you will not be able to see the token again." and " Treat your tokens like passwords and keep them secret. When working with the API, use tokens as environment variables instead of hardcoding them into your programs."

### Built with:
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) This gives you access to irb,
* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* [Github!](https://github.com/)

### Recommended Resources:
*Only head here after watching the video and following along. It's temptingly easy to get bogged down in reading and reading.* These are good resources... and the best thing to do sometimes is to write.
* [Short and visual Git orientation](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
* [Short Ruby tutorial](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/)
